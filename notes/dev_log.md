* Added Bayes' Theorem, ELBO, and Gaussian KL-Div notes for VAE
* Impelmented VAE
* Next: maybe read about some more complex VAEs, or move on to GANs

12/19/2024
* Added KL Divergence sparsity regularization
* Added Contractive regularization (does not enforce sparsity). Contractive loss is similar to denoising, makes latent robust to small deviations.
* Next: Denoising, then VAE

12/18/2024
* Implemented vanilla autoencoders, L1 regularization
* Next: KL-Divergence and contractive regularization, denoising autoencoder, then VAE
* Added useful class to override hyperparams from the CLI
* Switched from flake8 + black + isort to ruff
